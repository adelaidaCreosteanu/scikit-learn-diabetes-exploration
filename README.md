# scikit-learn-diabetes-exploration
This code explores several models for the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. I implement linear regression, polynomial regression, lasso regularisation, and decision trees.

I have used Anaconda virtual environment for this project. It's a great tool to manage packages!
